ISPPipe

Overview
====================
Basic demonstation of the suggested ma2150 ISP running within the SIPP framework. Note the settings here are for a low light situation

Hardware needed
==================
Myriad2 - This example works on Myriad2: ma2150, ma2450 silicon

Build
====================
Change directory to the required build platform.

build/myriad2 (mv0212 or mv0182 board): To build the project please type:
     - "make clean"
     - "make all MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

NOTE: Due to the larger code size, this app cannot build in debug mode, therefore an additional flag has been added to ingore the MV_BUILD_CONFIG=debug parameter. Code section is larger on ma2450

Setup
====================
MV0182
    - open terminal and type "make start_server"
    - open another terminal and type "make run MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

Expected output
====================
1. Expected displayed message: "moviUnitTest:PASSED"
2. Expected output file: An output image will be generated after run finishes
with the following characteristics:
- Name:            out_p444.yuv
- Location:        build/myriad2
- Format:          .yuv
- Size(WxH):       512x128
- Bits per sample: 8
- No. of planes:   3
- Open with tools: movImageCompare, Irfanview or pyuv
