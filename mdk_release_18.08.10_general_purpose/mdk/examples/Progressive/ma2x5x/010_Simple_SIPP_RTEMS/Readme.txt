Simple_SIPP_RTEMS

Supported Platform
==================
Myriad2 - This example works on Myriad2: ma2150, ma2450 silicon and
ma2150, ma2450 simulator

Overview
==========
Just starts RTEMS on Leon OS which then starts Leon RT.
Leon RT starts a simple SIPP Hardware Convolution test.

Software description
=======================
This application uses Leon OS which is running RTEMS to start Leon RT.

Hardware needed
==================
Myriad2 -This software should run on MV182 or MV212 boards.

Build
==================
Please type "make help" if you want to learn available targets.

!!!Before cross-compiling make sure you do a "make clean"!!!

 Myriad2 - To build the project please type:
     - "make clean"
     - "make all MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

NOTE: Due to the larger code size, this app cannot build in debug mode, therefore an additional flag has been added to ingore the MV_BUILD_CONFIG=debug parameter. Code section is larger on ma2150 ma2450

Setup
==================
Myriad2 silicon - To run the application:
    - open terminal and type make "start_server"
    - open another terminal and type "make run MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

Expected output
==================
The application output should be similar to:

UART: LeonOS Started.
UART: LeonRT Start Addr: 0x701C1000
UART: SIPP Convolution...
UART: Success!
UART: LeonRT Stop.
