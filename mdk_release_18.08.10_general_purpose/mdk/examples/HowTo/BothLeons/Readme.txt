BothLeons

Supported Platform
==================
Myriad2 - This example works on Myriad2: ma2150, ma2450 silicon and
ma2150, ma2450 simulator

Overview
==========
Prints "Hello world!" from both Leon processors

Software description
=======================
This application uses leon code for both LeonOS and LeonRT. Basically, these are the few steps made during the application:
    1. The Clock Power reset module is initialized.
    2. The DDR is also initialized.
    4. On this step, the setup is complete. The desired message can now be printed.

Hardware needed
==================
Myriad2 -This software should run on MV182 or MV212 boards.

Build
==================
Please type "make help" if you want to learn available targets.

!!!Before cross-compiling make sure you do a "make clean"!!!

Myriad2 - To build the project please type:
     - "make clean"
     - "make all MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

Setup
==================
Myriad2 simulator - To run the application:
    - open terminal and type "make start_simulator MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"
    - open another terminal and type "make run MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"
Myriad2 silicon - To run the application:
    - open terminal and type "make start_server"
    - open another terminal and type "make run MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

Expected output
==================
 The result  consist of a two printf messages seen on debugger terminal.
 Hello from LeonOS!
 Hello from LeonRT!
