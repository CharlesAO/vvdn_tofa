CheckingCycles

Supported Platform
==================
Myriad2 - This example works on Myriad2: ma2150, ma2450 silicon and
ma2150, ma2450 simulator

Overview
==========
Prints number of cycles passed for an addition


Software description
=======================

This application uses both the Leon and the Shave code.
Basically, these are the few steps made during the application:
    1. The Clock Power reset module is initialized.
    2. The timer is configured and started.
    3. The SHAVEs are started to perform the add operation.
    4. When the shave finishes its execution, the elapsed cycles of the entire process are shown.

This is a simple example on how to compute the basic operation cycle numbers.


Hardware needed
==================
Myriad2 -This software should run on MV182 or MV212 boards.

Build
==================
Please type "make help" if you want to learn available targets.

!!!Before cross-compiling make sure you do a "make clean"!!!

Myriad2 - To build the project please type:
     - "make clean"
     - "make all MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

Setup
==================
Myriad2 simulator - To run the application:
    - open terminal and type "make start_simulator MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"
    - open another terminal and type "make run MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"
Myriad2 silicon - To run the application:
    - open terminal and type "make start_server"
    - open another terminal and type "make run MV_SOC_REV={Myriad_version}"

Where {Myriad_version} may be ma2150 or ma2450.
The default Myriad revision in this project is ma2450 so it is not necessary
to specify the MV_SOC_REV in the terminal.

Expected output
==================
The results  consist in printf's seen using the debugger.
