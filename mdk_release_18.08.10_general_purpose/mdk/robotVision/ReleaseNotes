1. First release

Notes:
1.  The application shows a default tuning for vTrack. 
    Please note that for best performance, the vTrack, AEC and gyroAssist must be tuned 
    (depends on camera, target environment, target application). The number of the features, 
    the stability and the distribution of them will highly depend on this tuning. 

2.  The latency is a very important factor in tracking applications. This release does not 
    contain the optimal latency,it can be optimized:
        - the camera readout time can be optimized
        - the conversion time (~1.7ms) can be eliminated. Certain cameras can be configured
          to output u8 data. There is also a possibility to do the conversions with the Rx 
          filters when receiving the frame on myriad
        - first module of vTrack (pixelPipe) can already operate when the first line of the 
          frame arrived. This means that we can completely overlap the pixelPipe processing 
          with the readout time (~3ms)
        - The pyramidal optical flow is running on 2 shaves only. As the algorithm operates 
          on points, this can be split over any number of shaves. The speedup is linear, 
          power numbers remain the same, the only penalty being blocking more shaves for the 
          timeslice of OF
        - The latency numbers above are not including the USB readout. The USB readout time 
          can be minimized using an USB3. Also, usually the latency of the features matter, 
          not the latency of the actual image data. Sending the features before the frame 
          can reduce the transmission time 
   
3.  As the gyro bias is estimated by using the first few samples, the board must be still on 
    the desk in the first second after booting (keeping it in hand will not give best performance). 


Known issues (will be fixed by the next release):
1.  AEC has minor problems: 
        -   When changing from high contrast to low contrast mode, a jump on the image brightness 
            can appear. This jump can cause problems for vTrack
        -   In low light conditions the gain value becomes too high, adding noise to the image. 
            In this case wrong features and tracks may appear on the screen. This can be worked around 
            with a smaller Harris threshold, but we preferred tuning for the general case instead of 
            tuning for corner-cases.
2. The Pc applications might have small memory leak. Monitor your RAM usage if you need to run the 
   app for a very long time
